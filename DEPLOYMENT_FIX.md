# ðŸ”§ Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the Railway deployment error: `pip: command not found`

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated nixpacks.toml**
- Added `python311Packages.pip` to nixPkgs
- Updated install commands to use `python3.11 -m pip`
- Fixed start command to use `python3.11 -m streamlit`

### 2. **Added Dockerfile (Alternative)**
- Created a proper Dockerfile using Python 3.11 slim image
- Includes all necessary system dependencies
- Optimized for Railway deployment

### 3. **Updated railway.json**
- Changed builder from "NIXPACKS" to "DOCKERFILE"
- Removed redundant startCommand (now handled by Dockerfile)

### 4. **Updated Procfile**
- Changed to use `python3.11 -m streamlit` explicitly

## Deployment Options

### Option A: Dockerfile (Recommended)
Railway will automatically use the Dockerfile for building and deployment.

### Option B: Nixpacks
If you prefer nixpacks, the updated nixpacks.toml should work correctly.

## Environment Variables Required
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:LKCCrHKOKWyckhyBOyNnhFycKNTvEgIn@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:59937/railway
```
**Important**: Ensure no extra spaces in the connection string

## Expected Result
The application should now deploy successfully to:
**https://btock-production.up.railway.app/**

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure the repository is properly connected
4. Try redeploying from Railway dashboard
