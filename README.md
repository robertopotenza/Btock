# 📊 Stock KPI Scoring Dashboard

A web-based dashboard for evaluating stocks daily using multiple KPIs (**RSI, MACD, ADX, ATR, Moving Averages, CCI, Stochastic, Williams %R, ROC, Ultimate Oscillator, and Pivot Points**).  
The app ranks tickers with a **weighted scoring system** and outputs **BUY / HOLD / SELL** signals and a global score per ticker.

Built with **Streamlit**, deployable on **Railway**.  
Data is pulled from **Yahoo Finance** using the [`yfinance`](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) library.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload an **Excel or CSV** with a list of tickers (up to 250+).
- Enter **custom weights** for:
  - Momentum  
  - Trend  
  - Volatility  
  - Strength  
  - Support/Resistance  
- Run analysis and view results in a live interactive table.
- Download results as an **Excel file** with scores and signals.
- Simple to deploy on **Railway** or run locally.

---

## 📡 Data Source
- The system pulls **historical stock data (OHLCV)** directly from **Yahoo Finance** via the `yfinance` Python library.  
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, ATR, ADX, CCI, Stochastic, Williams %R, ROC, Ultimate Oscillator, Moving Averages, Pivot Points) are then **calculated locally** using [`pandas_ta`](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta).  
- This ensures consistent results across tickers without relying on external pre-computed feeds.

## 📊 How the Scoring Works

For each ticker, the system calculates scores across five key categories:

- **Momentum** → captures short-term signals (overbought/oversold).  
- **Trend** → measures the direction of the stock’s movement.  
- **Volatility** → tracks how strongly the price is moving day to day.  
- **Strength** → evaluates the reliability of the current trend.  
- **Support/Resistance** → positions the price relative to pivot levels.  

Each category produces a **normalized score**, and the user assigns weights to reflect its importance.  
These are combined into a **Final Weighted Score per ticker**.

The Final Score allows you to **rank and compare multiple stocks daily**, making it easy to filter which tickers are potential **BUY, HOLD, or SELL** candidates.

## 🔄 How the Scoring Normalization Works

  A[Input: OHLCV Data from Yahoo Finance] --> B1[Momentum KPIs: RSI, Stoch, StochRSI, Williams %R, ROC, Ultimate Osc]
  A --> B2[Trend KPIs: MACD, MA5-200, Bull/Bear Power]
  A --> B3[Volatility KPIs: ATR, Highs/Lows]
  A --> B4[Strength KPIs: ADX, CCI]
  A --> B5[Support/Resistance KPIs: Pivot Points - Classic, Fibonacci, Camarilla, Woodie, DeMark]

  B1 --> C1[Normalize to range -1 to +1]
  B2 --> C2[Normalize to range -1 to +1]
  B3 --> C3[Normalize to range -1 to +1]
  B4 --> C4[Normalize to range -1 to +1]
  B5 --> C5[Normalize to range -1 to +1]

  C1 --> D1[Momentum Score = average of normalized KPIs]
  C2 --> D2[Trend Score = average of normalized KPIs]
  C3 --> D3[Volatility Score = average of normalized KPIs]
  C4 --> D4[Strength Score = average of normalized KPIs]
  C5 --> D5[Support/Resistance Score = average of normalized KPIs]

    W2[Trend weight wT]
    W3[Volatility weight wV]
    W4[Strength weight wS]
    W5[Support/Resistance weight wP]
  end

  D1 --> E1[(wM × Momentum)]
  D2 --> E2[(wT × Trend)]
  D3 --> E3[(wV × Volatility)]
  D4 --> E4[(wS × Strength)]
  D5 --> E5[(wP × Support/Res)]

  E1 --> F[Final Weighted Score = sum of weighted category scores]
  E2 --> F
  E3 --> F
  E4 --> F
  E5 --> F

  F --> G{Decision}
  G --> H1[BUY if Score greater than 0.5]
  G --> H2[HOLD if Score between -0.5 and 0.5]
  G --> H3[SELL if Score less than -0.5]

🔧 Developer Notes

Input file must contain a column named Ticker.

Skip invalid tickers but keep them in the results with an “Error” message.

Enforce or auto-normalize weights to sum = 1.0 (to ensure scores are consistent and comparable).

Thresholds for BUY / HOLD / SELL should be configurable via the dashboard.

Output Excel should include:

Ticker

Current price

Category Scores (Momentum, Trend, Volatility, Strength, Support/Resistance)

Final Weighted Score

Signal

Show results in a sortable Streamlit table before download.

Add a progress bar for large ticker lists (250+).
