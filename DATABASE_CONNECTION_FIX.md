# 🗄️ Database Connection Fix

## Issue Identified
The Railway deployment was failing with:
```
FATAL: database "railway " does not exist
```

The issue was an extra space in the database name in the connection string.

## ✅ Correct Database Connection String

**Use this exact connection string in Railway environment variables:**

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:LKCCrHKOKWyckhyBOyNnhFycKNTvEgIn@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:59937/railway
```

**Important**: No space after "railway" in the database name.

## Database Status

✅ **Connection**: Verified working  
✅ **Schema**: All tables exist (analysis_sessions, ticker_results, indicator_data)  
✅ **Version**: PostgreSQL 17.6  

## Railway Environment Variable Setup

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** → Your Project → Variables
2. **Add Environment Variable**:
   - **Name**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: `postgresql://postgres:LKCCrHKOKWyckhyBOyNnhFycKNTvEgIn@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:59937/railway`
3. **Save** and **Redeploy**

## Verification

The database connection has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Server is reachable
- ✅ Authentication successful
- ✅ Database "railway" exists
- ✅ All required tables are present

## Application Features Ready

Once the correct DATABASE_URL is set in Railway, the application will have:
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ Analysis result storage
- ✅ Historical data tracking
- ✅ Performance analytics

The database is fully configured and ready for production use!
