# Btock Dashboard - Bug Fix Deployment Instructions

## Bug Fix Summary

**Issue**: The dashboard did not respect the number of tickers selected in the "Tickers to display" dropdown. The application always fetched and displayed data for all 212 tickers, with the frontend simply hiding excess rows. This caused inefficiency and made the Excel export feature ignore user selection.

**Solution**: Modified the application to pass the user's ticker count selection to the backend API, which now dynamically modifies the prompt sent to the Grok API to process only the requested number of tickers.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`public/app.js`)
- **Added limit parameter**: The `fetchData()` function now passes the selected limit to the backend API via query parameter
- **Removed client-side filtering**: Eliminated the `applyTickerLimit()` function since the backend now returns correctly sized data
- **Simplified rendering**: The `renderContent()` function no longer needs to hide rows client-side

### Backend Changes (`server.js`)
- **Dynamic prompt generation**: The `loadPrompt()` function now accepts a `tickerLimit` parameter and constructs the document with only the requested number of tickers
- **Updated API endpoints**: Both `/api/dashboard` and `/api/dashboard/export` now accept and use the `limit` parameter
- **Improved caching**: Cache now considers the ticker limit to avoid serving incorrect data
- **Accurate prompt text**: The prompt sent to Grok now reflects the actual number of tickers being processed (e.g., "there are 10, starting from row 2 to row 11")

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Reduced API costs**: Only processes the requested number of tickers through Grok API
2. **Faster response times**: Smaller datasets load quicker
3. **Accurate Excel exports**: Download feature now truly respects user selection
4. **Better user experience**: No more loading unnecessary data

## Deployment Steps

### For Railway (Current Production)

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Since the repository is connected to Railway, the changes should deploy automatically after the git push.

2. **Manual Deployment** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Connect to Railway (if not already connected)
   railway login
   
   # Deploy the latest changes
   railway up
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Visit https://btock-production.up.railway.app/
   - Test the dropdown functionality with different ticker counts
   - Verify that the Excel export respects the selection

### For Other Platforms

#### Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

#### Heroku
```bash
# Login to Heroku
heroku login

# Create app (if new deployment)
heroku create btock-dashboard

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

#### Manual Server Deployment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/robertopotenza/Btock.git
cd Btock

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set environment variables
export grok_key="your_grok_api_key_here"
export GROK_MODEL="grok-3"
export PORT="3000"

# Start the application
npm start
```

## Environment Variables Required

- `grok_key` or `GROK_KEY`: Your Grok API key from https://console.x.ai/
- `GROK_MODEL`: Model to use (default: "grok-3")
- `PORT`: Port number (default: 3000)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Load the dashboard**: Visit the application URL
2. **Select "First 10"**: Choose from the dropdown and verify only 10 tickers are processed
3. **Select "First 50"**: Verify 50 tickers are processed
4. **Select "All"**: Verify all 212 tickers are processed
5. **Test Excel export**: Download should contain only the selected number of tickers
6. **Check performance**: Smaller selections should load faster than "All"

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, you can rollback to the previous version:

```bash
# Revert to the previous commit
git revert bfc6a5e

# Push the revert
git push origin main
```

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Cache invalidation is handled automatically based on ticker limit
- No database changes required
- No breaking changes to the API structure
