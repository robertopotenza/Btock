Using the attached database of tickers, URLs, and company names (provided in the <DOCUMENT> XML structure below), perform the following task:

For each ticker in the list (there are over 200, starting from row 2 to row 213), use the browse_page tool to visit the corresponding URL. In the instructions argument for browse_page, specify: "Extract and summarize key technical analysis data from this page, including:

CURRENT STOCK PRICE:
- Current Price: Extract the current stock price using the CSS selector [data-test="instrument-price-last"]

SUMMARY DATA:
- Technical Indicators summary (buy/sell/neutral counts and overall recommendation)
- Moving Averages summary (buy/sell/neutral counts and overall recommendation)

KEY OSCILLATORS (extract value and action for each):
- RSI (14): Relative Strength Index value and action
- Stochastic (9,6): Stochastic oscillator value and action
- Williams %R: Williams Percent Range value and action

KEY TREND INDICATORS (extract value and action for each):
- MACD (12,26): Moving Average Convergence Divergence value and action
- ADX (14): Average Directional Index value and action
- CCI (14): Commodity Channel Index value and action

ESSENTIAL MOVING AVERAGES (extract value and action for each):
- MA20: Simple and Exponential moving averages (20-period)
- MA50: Simple and Exponential moving averages (50-period)
- MA200: Simple and Exponential moving averages (200-period)

PIVOT POINTS (extract key levels):
- Classic Pivot Points: S2, S1, Pivot Point, R1, R2
- Fibonacci Pivot Points: S1, Pivot Point, R1

Structure the output as a JSON object with keys for each category. If any data is missing or the page fails to load, note it as N/A. Focus only on the technical analysis sections and ignore news, charts, or other unrelated content."

Since there are many tickers, make parallel function calls to browse_page for batches of URLs (e.g., 10-20 at a time) to efficiently gather data without exceeding tool limits. Once all data is collected, compile it into a single comprehensive Markdown table (matrix) with columns for:

Ticker, Company_Name, Price, TI_Summary, TI_Buy_Count, TI_Neutral_Count, TI_Sell_Count, MA_Summary, MA_Buy_Count, MA_Sell_Count, RSI_Value, RSI_Action, Stochastic_Value, Stochastic_Action, Williams_R_Value, Williams_R_Action, MACD_Value, MACD_Action, ADX_Value, ADX_Action, CCI_Value, CCI_Action, MA20_Simple_Value, MA20_Simple_Action, MA20_Exp_Value, MA20_Exp_Action, MA50_Simple_Value, MA50_Simple_Action, MA50_Exp_Value, MA50_Exp_Action, MA200_Simple_Value, MA200_Simple_Action, MA200_Exp_Value, MA200_Exp_Action, Classic_S2, Classic_S1, Classic_Pivot, Classic_R1, Classic_R2, Fibonacci_S1, Fibonacci_Pivot, Fibonacci_R1.

Include the current date in the response for reference (e.g., "Data as of [current date]"). If any extraction fails for a ticker, mark those fields as N/A in the table. Output only the final table after all data is gatheredâ€”no intermediate steps in the final response.
