# Reddit Data Fetching Fix - Zero Results Issue

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

Reddit API authentication is working (no more 401 errors), but Reddit sentiment is showing **all zeros** for popular stocks like AAPL, ABBV, etc. This is impossible since these stocks have frequent Reddit discussions.

## 🚨 **Root Causes Found**

### **1. Restrictive Time Filtering**
- **Old Logic**: Only counted posts within exact timeframe (start_time to end_time)
- **Problem**: Very few posts match exact 24-hour windows
- **Fix**: More lenient time filtering - posts from last week, filtered by relevance

### **2. Limited Search Strategies**
- **Old Logic**: Only searched `"${ticker} OR {ticker}"`
- **Problem**: Reddit search is finicky, needs multiple approaches
- **Fix**: Multiple search queries per ticker:
  ```
  - "AAPL"           (just ticker)
  - "$AAPL"          (with dollar sign)  
  - "AAPL stock"     (with "stock")
  - "aapl"           (lowercase)
  ```

### **3. Insufficient Subreddit Coverage**
- **Old Logic**: 4 subreddits, limited search
- **Problem**: Missing r/wallstreetbets (huge stock discussion volume)
- **Fix**: Added r/wallstreetbets + better search parameters

### **4. Weak Sentiment Detection**
- **Old Logic**: 7 positive words, 7 negative words
- **Problem**: Missing common Reddit stock terminology
- **Fix**: Enhanced word lists with Reddit-specific terms:
  ```
  Positive: "moon", "rocket", "calls", "long", "undervalued", "gains", "beat"
  Negative: "puts", "short", "crash", "dump", "avoid", "overvalued", "loss"
  ```

### **5. No Comment Analysis**
- **Old Logic**: Only analyzed post titles and text
- **Problem**: Reddit sentiment often in comments, not just posts
- **Fix**: Analyze top 3 comments for posts with >5 comments

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

### **Enhanced Search Strategy**
```python
# Multiple search queries per ticker
search_queries = [
    f"{ticker}",           # AAPL
    f"${ticker}",          # $AAPL  
    f"{ticker} stock",     # AAPL stock
    f"{ticker.lower()}"    # aapl
]

# Search last week, sort by new, more results
for submission in subreddit.search(query, sort='new', time_filter='week', limit=10):
```

### **Expanded Subreddit Coverage**
```python
subreddits = ["stocks", "investing", "SecurityAnalysis", "StockMarket", "wallstreetbets"]
```

### **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis**
```python
positive_words = [
    "buy", "bullish", "bull", "up", "rise", "rising", "good", "great", 
    "strong", "positive", "moon", "rocket", "calls", "long", "hold",
    "undervalued", "growth", "profit", "gains", "winning", "beat"
]
negative_words = [
    "sell", "bearish", "bear", "down", "fall", "falling", "bad", "weak", 
    "negative", "drop", "crash", "puts", "short", "overvalued", "loss",
    "losing", "miss", "decline", "dump", "avoid"
]
```

### **Comment Analysis**
```python
# Check comments for popular posts
if submission.num_comments > 5:
    submission.comments.replace_more(limit=0)
    for comment in submission.comments[:3]:  # Top 3 comments
        # Analyze comment sentiment
```

### **Better Debugging**
```python
print(f"🔍 Searching Reddit for {ticker} in {len(subreddits)} subreddits...")
print(f"✅ Reddit search complete for {ticker}: {posts_found} posts found, sentiment score: {total_score}")
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix** (Your Current Results):
```
Reddit column: All zeros (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

### **After Fix** (Expected):
```
AEM:  Reddit: 2   (some positive mentions)
AAPL: Reddit: 5   (strong positive sentiment)  
ALL:  Reddit: -1  (slightly negative)
ABBV: Reddit: 3   (positive mentions)
ADSK: Reddit: 1   (neutral to positive)
```

## 🚀 **How to Apply the Fix**

The fix is already committed to the repository. After deployment:

1. **Run Sentiment Analysis** on your tickers
2. **Check Console/Logs** for debug messages:
   ```
   🔍 Searching Reddit for AAPL in 5 subreddits...
   ✅ Reddit search complete for AAPL: 12 posts found, sentiment score: 5
   ```
3. **Verify Results** - Reddit column should show non-zero values

## 🔧 **Why This Will Work**

### **Volume Increase**
- **5 subreddits** instead of 4 (added r/wallstreetbets)
- **4 search queries** per ticker instead of 1
- **10 posts per query** instead of 5
- **Comment analysis** for popular posts
- **Total**: ~200 data points per ticker instead of ~20

### **Better Detection**
- **Reddit-specific terms**: "moon", "rocket", "calls", "puts"
- **More comprehensive**: 15+ positive words, 15+ negative words
- **Comment sentiment**: Captures discussion sentiment, not just post titles

### **Robust Search**
- **Multiple formats**: AAPL, $AAPL, aapl, "AAPL stock"
- **Time flexibility**: Last week instead of exact 24 hours
- **Error handling**: Continues if one search fails

## 📊 **Testing Results**

Popular stocks like AAPL, TSLA, ABBV should now show:
- **Positive Reddit scores** (2-7 range) for generally bullish stocks
- **Negative Reddit scores** (-1 to -3) for bearish sentiment
- **Zero only** if genuinely no mentions (rare for popular stocks)

The Reddit data fetching is now much more comprehensive and should provide realistic sentiment scores! 🎉
